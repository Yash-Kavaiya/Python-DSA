Here’s a **step-by-step guide for approaching and solving coding problems** based on the content from the video:

**1. Read the Problem Carefully**
- Read the problem statement at least twice or thrice, especially if it is descriptive or has a lot of information.
- Identify if there are any **hints, test cases, or examples** given.

**2. Extract and Write Down Information**
- Collect all important information from the problem and jot it down using pen and paper.
- Make a note of inputs, outputs, and any constraints mentioned.

**3. Break Down the Problem**
- For medium and hard problems, **break the problem into smaller parts or modules**.
- Understand what each module needs to accomplish.

**4. Review the Examples and Test Cases**
- Go through the given examples to see input-output mapping and explanation.
- Try to figure out the underlying logic from these examples.

**5. Carefully Check Constraints**
- Look at constraints (such as maximum input size) to **determine feasible approaches** (e.g., O(N^2) or O(N^3) solutions).
- Constraints often hint at acceptable time and space complexities.

**6. Consider Edge Cases**
- Think about edge cases (special/unusual inputs) that may not be covered in regular test cases.
- Note any edge cases you uncover for the problem.

**7. Plan the Solution**
- Before coding, use pen and paper to outline a **brute-force (basic) approach** first.
- Analyze its complexity (e.g., O(N^3)). If it works in time limits, proceed; otherwise, plan to optimize.

**8. Move to Optimal Solution**
- Once the brute-force approach is understood, **think about optimizing** to reduce time/space complexity.

**9. Code and Test**
- Implement the solution and match your answers with the test cases and examples.
- If results don't match, revisit your approach and especially check for missed edge cases.

**10. Manage Your Time**
- Do not spend too long (5–7 minutes) on a single problem if stuck—move to the next one.
- Start with easy problems to build confidence, then progress to medium and hard problems.

**Summary Table**

| Step               | Action                                                        |
|--------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------|
| 1. Read Carefully  | Read 2–3 times, look for hints and examples                  |
| 2. Note Info       | Write down all details, input, output, constraints           |
| 3. Break Down      | Divide into smaller modules/steps if complex                 |
| 4. Review Cases    | Study given examples/test cases thoroughly                   |
| 5. Analyze Constraints | Use constraints to determine complexity and approach     |
| 6. Edge Cases      | Think and list edge and special cases                        |
| 7. Brute Force     | Plan out the basic solution first                            |
| 8. Optimize        | Refactor solution for efficiency                             |
| 9. Code & Test     | Implement and verify against test cases                      |
| 10. Manage Time    | Don’t get stuck too long, move on if needed                  |

**Tips:**
- Always start with easier problems to build confidence.
- Take notes and test edge cases.
- Prioritize understanding the problem fully before coding.
- Don’t dwell too long on one problem—move on and return later if stuck.

This structured, methodical approach will make you a more effective problem solver in coding interviews and competitive programming alike!
